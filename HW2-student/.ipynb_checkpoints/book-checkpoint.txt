1 P1   INT. OSAGE LODGE MADE OF BARK CIRCA 1900                       1 P1

       We see eyes through cracks and openings of the bark. We see
       slices of faces peering in. We hear:

               NON-HON-ZHIN-GA                  NON-HON-ZHIN-GA
          (overlap)                      Kah-see(n) ta(n) theh-ksheh

       CUT TO THE PIPE in his hand.

       Old Osage men sit in a circle around a small fire in the
       center of the lodge. Osage women sit in an outer circle next
       to the walls of the lodge. The Non-hon-zhin-ga leads the
       meeting. He is holding the Pipe.

       He stops - he wraps the Pipe. The WIFE OF THE PIPE KEEPER
       receives the Pipe bundle.

                                                         TIME CUT:

P2     The WIFE OF THE KEEPER OF THE PIPE holds the Pipe which is         P2
       wrapped in a woven cover. She cradles it in her arms and
       close to her breasts and in her grief she rocks The Pipe as
       she would rock an infant. The woman and ANOTHER PIPE MOURNER
       wail a prayer song for one who has died.

1   INT. TRAIN CAR � MOVING � SPRING, 1919                           1

    The train is crowded with travelers, WWI Soldiers (Osage and
    white), oil executives/engineers, Osage families, vagabonds
    and hustlers. We come upon ERNEST BURKHART (white, 30s) his
    uniform half off, half drunk, heading back home.

                                                      CUT TO:



2   EXT. TRAIN DEPOT/FAIRFAX � DAY                                   2

    The train pulls into the station and the variety of
    passengers get off � into a mass of activity � hustlers,
    families reuniting, businessmen, shoppers -

    Ernest steps onto the platform and takes it all in.

    A well dressed little person hands Ernest a flier � he reads
    it: "Make it Rich". As Ernest walks past the TAXI STAND he
    sees very well dressed well-to-do Osage greeting their
    families and getting into beautiful cars. We see four or five
    poor sketchy characters who are loitering around the station
    looking hungrily at the well-to-do Osage. Ernest reacts. Then
    a fight breaks out. Ernest skirts around it and through the
    fight a large man comes from behind him: HENRY ROAN (Osage,
    30s) Very handsome, striking, well-dressed, hair in braids.

                          HENRY ROAN
              Ernest?    Ernest Burkhart?

                        ERNEST
              ...Yeah?...

                        HENRY ROAN
              I'm Henry - Henry Roan.

                          ERNEST
              Henry...

              I'm to take you to your Uncle Hale.

4   EXT. HALE'S RANCH � DAY                                           4

    They drive under a sign that says, "HALE RANCH" and there are
    no derricks here. This is a cattle ranch.

    UNCLE WILLIAM   HALE, KING OF THE OSAGE (60s) comes out to meet
    Ernest with a   warm greeting, accompanied by his wife MYRTLE
    "MYRTIE" HALE   and daughter WILLIE. Hale mutters something to
    Henry Roan in   broken Osage...

    Hale just holds on tightly to Ernest, happy he's back alive.



5   INT. HALE'S RANCH � LIVING ROOM                                   5

    Hale and Ernest, sitting together by the fire...

                        HALE
              Times like this people put castles
              in the air, held aloft by hysteria,
              rush blind with greed, based on
              fear, unfounded fear. Fear running
              all over the place and screaming
              like animals.

              This is a cattle ranch. There's no
              oil here. So I'm settled with no
              fear.

              These Osage have had enough
              trouble, they're down to not too
              many of them left.

              There's a way that nature moves and
              changes direction and that's
              happened upon them. Time will run
              out, this wealth will run dry drier
              than the seven years of famine that
              plagued the Pharaohs of old.
              They're sick people. Big hearted
              but sickly.

              You saw bloodshed?

                        ERNEST
              Well, some... I was a cook in
              Infantry.

                    HALE
          Did you see Kelsie Morrison, he was
          over there.

                    ERNEST
          I did. Otis Griggs and others. If
          you remember...

                    HALE
          Soldiers have to eat. You fed the
          soldiers that won the war.

                    ERNEST
          Saw more die from the flu.

Hale looks at him.

                    HALE
          What happened to your stomach?

                    ERNEST
          My gut burst.

                    HALE
          You're lucky to be alive.

                    ERNEST
          They gave me a belt. Told me not to
          do heavy lifting.

                    HALE
          You made a good choice coming back
          here. Texas got nothing. So much
          changed last years of what's
          happened. Hard to recognize the
          place I can tell you that... Money
          is spent freely here now.

                    ERNEST
          Yes, sir. The oil, sir.

                    HALE
          There's very much money.

                    ERNEST
          I love money, sir.

                    HALE
          You call me Uncle or King...
          remember?

                     ERNEST
          King.

          Did you pick up any disease?

                      ERNEST
          No.

                    HALE
          Keep that thing wrapped up over
          there?

                      ERNEST
          Yes, sir.

                    HALE
          You like women.

                    ERNEST
          Yes, King, course I do, it's a
          weakness.

                    HALE
          What kinds they have out there?

                    ERNEST
          Just white that I saw.

                    HALE
          You like red?

                    ERNEST
          Red and white, I don't mind. I like
          all of `em, I'm greedy. I like
          heavy ones, pretty ones, soft ones,
          ones that smell good.

Hale pours some Whiskey. In the b.g., through the front door
enters: BYRON BURKHART, Ernest's brother, comes over to join
them.

                    HALE
          Taste that.

                      ERNEST
          Good.

                    HALE
          Don't get played out in the open
          with liquor or you'll cause
          trouble. That right, Byron?

                    BYRON
          That's right, King.

Ernest looks from his brother Byron back to his Uncle.

          There's only one deputy Sheriff I
          don't hold a commission under... I
          am officially a reserve deputy
          sheriff in Fairfax... but I don't
          want to bring unwanted eyes...

                    ERNEST
          I will not find that trouble, I
          won't do stupid things.

                    HALE
          Is your head on straight after
          being over there?

                    ERNEST
          Yes of course. I'm not thick, sir,
          I'm strong -

                    HALE
          I have a place to put you, driving.
          I'll put you there, that's for you.
          Cause you can't do much else `cause
          of your gut. Most fellows out here
          are crooked, some do things well,
          most do bad, don't be simple.

                    ERNEST
          No, sir, I won't.

                    HALE
          Don't make small trouble about
          things... If you make trouble, make
          it big - get a big payoff from
          this, you see? You don't read do
          you?

                    ERNEST
          I can read.

                    HALE
          You smarten yourself up.

                     ERNEST
          I read �

Hale reaches over and gets a book (shows Ernest who leafs
through the pages) -

                    HALE
          Osage are sharp. They don't talk
          much so that might make you run
          your mouth to fill the space.

              But it's better to be quiet if you
              don't have something smart to say.
              Don't get caught on that - it's
              just what they call "blackbird
              talk" (imitating) "cheep cheep".
              Just because they're not talking
              doesn't mean they don't know things
              about everything. Osage are the
              finest and most beautiful people on

              Yes, sir.

              I've a prescription now at Fairfax

              You know she's restricted, too, so
              we have to account for every penny.
              It says here she spent $319.05 on
              meat at the grocery! Don't you
              think that's an awful lot of meat
              for what she needs?

                        MOLLIE
              Yes, Mr. Beaty...

                        PITTS BEATY
              Well you look after that, won't

               Mollie... this way - lot of
               characters around here today - be
               careful.

     He opens the door for her as an IMPROMPTU CAR RACE speeds by

     Ernest rushes Mollie into the car. Two of the people rushing
     after are KELSIE MORRISON (white, 30s) local hustler,
     flamboyant dress and CATHERINE COLE, (OSAGE) his wife.

                         KELSIE
               Hey Ernest!(to Catherine) We were
               at the front together in France.

               mm I know, Uncle, which one, I
               know her. I've been drivin' her -

               Drivin' her... well Matt Williams
               used to go with her for a time and
               she's not, they're not together in
               a way now � so that means you could
               have a proposition at that if that
               struck you �

                         ERNEST
               you want me to see after Mollie?
               Why she's a regular customer of
               mine. (sotto voce) And I think she
               likes me...

                         HALE
               that Mollie's easy to like and a
               full blood Estate at that, that's
               something a man could work with...

     Ernest gets it, thinks, turns and looks at his brother
     Byron...who nods at him...as if Byron has already heard this idea
     and is encouraging Ernest...

                         ERNEST
               how do you mean?

     Ernest looks again to Byron...Byron looks back.

                         HALE
               -- we mix these families together
               and that estate money flows the
               right direction, will come to us -
               That's a full blood estate, and she
               gets that money of her Mother
               Lizzie. That's good business that
               and legal. Not against a law,

21   EXT. POOL HALL/FAIRFAX � DAWN                                      21

     Ernest and the rest leaving the pool hall at dawn, dejected,
     head in different directions. Ernest gets in his cab.

                           ERNEST (READING, V.O.)
               "Dawn was always a sacred time for
               prayers..."



22   EXT. LIZZIE/MOLLIE'S GRAY HORSE HOME � DAWN                        22

     LIZZIE Q., Traditional Osage, Mollie's mother, prays at dawn
     by a creek near the house.

                         ERNEST (V.O.)
               "They call the sun `grandfather.'
               The moon `mother.' Fire, `Father.'"

     SEE: A SUN THROUGH THE CLOUDS. A CRESCENT MOON. A WILDFIRE
     BURNING THE PRAIRIE.

                         ERNEST (V.O.)
               They call it the "flower moon" �
               when tiny flowers spread over the
               blackjack hills and prairies. There
               are so many, it's as if a spring
               festival of the gods left confetti
               there. (Matthews p.61)
            KOTFM - Final Shooting Script - August 10, 2022         18.


     We see tiny Spring flowers spread over the prairie.



23   EXT. BRUSH ARBOR/OSAGE VILLAGE � SUNRISE                            23

     The baby naming ceremony. Ernest stands by the car, watching
     Mollie and the ceremony from a distance. Mollie's extended
     family is here.

                         ERNEST (V.O.)
               ... given your Osage name - it's
               how you will be called to the next
               world - your Osage name can never
               be taken away from you.



24   EXT. LIZZIE/MOLLIE'S GRAY HORSE HOME � ANOTHER DAY/AFTERNOON        24

     Ernest pulls up to Mollie's Homestead. Servants. A few male
     ranch hands take care of the property. Ernest, carrying
     shopping bags, helps Mollie to her door. Mollie hands Ernest
     a box. He opens it. It's a hat.

                         MOLLIE
               Here put this on.

     Ernest tries on the hat...

                         MOLLIE (CONT'D)
               Do you want dinner?

                         ERNEST
               Yes.



25   INT. LIZZIE/MOLLIE'S GRAY HORSE HOME � THAT MOMENT                  25

     As Ernest steps inside, he sees: LIZZIE Q, Mollie's mother.
     She stares at him, he nods to her. She is very old and in
     traditional Osage style rests on the floor... he tries a
     smile at her, she doesn't.

                         ERNEST (V.O.)
               Wah-Kon-Tah, means God. The special
               ones who went ahead in the fog to
               new places are called, "Travelers
               in the Mist."

26   INT. LIZZIE/MOLLIE'S GRAY HORSE HOME - DINING ROOM               26

     Mollie and Ernest finishing their dinner... She offers him a
     CIGARELLO. Lizzie is asleep in the next room. They speak
     quietly:

                         ERNEST
               Don't you want a bite of this?

                         MOLLIE
               I got too much sugar.

                         ERNEST
               You can never be too sweet now can
               you?

                         MOLLIE
               It makes me sickly.

                         ERNEST
               [He eats. Then] You live in this
               house just with your Mother?

                         MOLLIE
               I take care for her.    You live with
               your Uncle.

                         ERNEST
               Yes. Do you know him?

                         MOLLIE
               Since I can remember.

                         ERNEST
               He's a nice man.

                         MOLLIE
               Why did you come here?

                         ERNEST
               ...for what?

                         MOLLIE
               To live here?

                         ERNEST
               Yes. I live here.

                         MOLLIE
               Why?

                         ERNEST
               For my Uncle. I work with him.
       KOTFM - Final Shooting Script - August 10, 2022   20.


                    MOLLIE
          Your brother is Bryan.

                    ERNEST
          Byron. That's right.

                    MOLLIE
          There's more...

                    ERNEST
          More brothers? Horace and Duke.
          Yes.

                    MOLLIE
          Are you scared of him?

                    ERNEST
          My brother... Who?

                    MOLLIE
          ...Your Uncle.

                    ERNEST
          Well, no. He's the King of the
          Osage Hills. He's the nicest man in
          the world but I know if you cross
          him what he can do.

          I'm my own man, I do my own work.
          I'm a businessman.

silence, then:

                    ERNEST (CONT'D)
          My uncle doesn't scare me... you
          have all those sisters?

                    MOLLIE
          ...What is your religion?

                    ERNEST
          ... I'm Catholic...

                    MOLLIE
          You don't come to church.

                    ERNEST
          I've, yes, I've been away. How come
          you don't have a husband?

                    MOLLIE
          ...
       KOTFM - Final Shooting Script - August 10, 2022         21.


                    ERNEST
          I'm a man and I want to know why a
          woman like you doesn't have a
          husband?

                       MOLLIE
          ...

                    ERNEST
          You have nice color skin...

Mollie looks.

                    ERNEST (CONT'D)
          What color would you say that is?

                    MOLLIE
          ... My color.

                    ERNEST
          Well, I think it's pretty. You got
          nice color skin. You got a nice
          house. And I think you just
          pretend to be so severe. I bet you
          have a soft belly on the inside...

            MOLLIE                          MOLLIE
psh, Trickster...               Eh-sheh, sho-mee-kah-see...

                    ERNEST
          Did you say Coyote?... Well, if I'm
          a coyote and you're a raven... we
          can help each other out.

                    MOLLIE
          ...Coyote wants money.

                    ERNEST
          Well that money's real nice,
          especially if you're lazy like
          me... I want to sleep all day and
          make a party when it's dark...

RAIN starts to fall. We can hear it through an OPEN WINDOW.

            MOLLIE                          MOLLIE
Do you like whiskey?            Do you like peh-tseh nee?

                    ERNEST
          I don't like whiskey, I love
          whiskey.

                         MOLLIE
               I have good whiskey, not bad
               whiskey.

                         ERNEST
               I think we should try some and find
               out...

     Mollie gets up to get a bottle. We hear THUNDER. Wind is
     blowing the rain in. Ernest gets up to close the window.

                         MOLLIE
               No. Don't close it.

                          ERNEST
               What?

                         MOLLIE
               We need to be quiet for awhile. Sit
               down.

     They go back and sit.

     He looks at her. She looks at him. He looks over at Lizzie.

                         MOLLIE (CONT'D)
               A storm is... well it's powerful.
               So we need to be quiet now.

     An awkward moment.

                         ERNEST
               Well... it's good for the cattle.
               That's for sure...

                         MOLLIE
               Just be still.

     There's a solemnity that comes over the two of them. A bond.

28   INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH � DAYS LATER                                  28

     Ernest has joined Mollie for Sunday services. Mollie's
     sisters are here: ANNA (the wild one) RETA (sensible one)
     MINNIE (the weak one). And MINNIE'S HUSBAND, BILL SMITH
     (white, 30s).

                         PRIEST
               Let us pray. (Ora pro nobis)

     Ernest stands. Then - embarrassed - sees that everyone is
     kneeling. Bill Smith is doing it right. Gives Ernest a look.
     (Sizing each other up.)



29   EXT. CATHOLIC CHURCH � SAME DAY                                    29

     A gathering, picnic after Church. Osage style with people
     eating on the ground. A SHINNY game being played nearby -
     Ernest watches with PAUL RED EAGLE.

     Hale standing with a group of Osage men including Henry Roan
     watching an OSAGE ARTIST PAINTING THE SCENE. They're laughing
     together. He notices Bill Smith with Minnie who's sitting
     with her sisters eating. An OLDER OSAGE WOMAN leans over to
     give Minnie something and reveals a knife under her clothing.
     Hale looks over to Ernest - then to Mollie.

     Ernest looks over to Mollie and her sisters.

     Ernest and Mollie parked out away from Mollie's house, like
     teenagers making out in the back of the car. She puts his
     hand on her stomach, looks down at it.

                            MOLLIE
                  Your hand looks on my skin...

                            ERNEST
                  You're going to marry me Mollie. I
                  want you to be my wife.

                  Will you do that?

     They kiss.

                            HALE (V.O.)
                  ...Can you stand her?

                  She's easy to like.

                  Will she be intimate with you when
                  you need that? Whenever you desire
                  that?

                            ERNEST
                  Yes. She's... she's not a nag...

     UNDER AN ARBOR, THE TRADITIONAL OSAGE LEADER BLESSES in OSAGE
     the newly married Mollie and Ernest. Witnessed by all of Gray
     Horse and Fairfax. An Osage style reception. Extended family
     and Kelsie Morrison and Catherine Cole. The BIGHEARTS: GRACE
     and JOHN (wearing his traditional roach) and BERTHA and JOE.

     A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE holding a BIBLE stands with Bill Hale.
     TRADITIONAL OSAGE LEADER crossfades with Bill Hale's voice:
     his own blessing:

                         HALE
               I've known Mollie and her sisters
               since they were little girls
               running around making trouble... I
               just want to say on behalf of my
               wife Myrtle and my daughter Willie,
               I'm just so glad a member of my
               family is mixin' with the great Pah-
               soo-oh-leen. Mollie's dear departed
               father, Nah-kah-e-se-y, was my
               beloved friend of the heart. He
               used to tell the white men to just
               call him Jimmy, but I called him by
               his proper name...

     As Hale's voice continues, we see -



34   EXT. LIZZIE/MOLLIE'S GRAY HORSE HOME � LATER                        34

     Mollie presiding over an Osage "giveaway". A HORSE decorated
     with blanket is presented to THE TRADITIONAL LEADER as a
     gift. Lizzie straightens up her daughters' wedding coats and
     An Osage woman takes a photo of wedding party with the LATEST
     CAMERA.

     Band playing (white music) - people dancing - noticeably
     Kelsie.

     Hale's POV. He goes through the crowd - glad handing like a
     politician � but focused on Minnie who looks weak and Bill.
     He reaches them ignores Bill Smith - there's tension:

                         HALE
               What do you need for, Minnie?

                          MINNIE
               No. Sir.

                         HALE
               You're well taken care of? You have
               proper medicines?
            KOTFM - Final Shooting Script - August 10, 2022         27.


                           MINNIE
               Yes.

                         HALE
               Because I want you to know that you
               have the best care if you need... I
               don't want you to be afraid.

                            MINNIE
                      (tearing up)

                  HALE                            HALE
     So many troubles. What we've    So many troubles. What we've
     brought on you... I'm           brought on you... I'm
     sorry... I hear it in the       sorry... Tah-tseh kee eh ah-

                                     what you Osage say...

     Hale invokes an Osage prayer for Minnie... All the while,
     freezing out Bill Smith... who looks away.

                  HALE (CONT'D)                   HALE (CONT'D)
     Great Mystery                   Wah-kohn-dah

     Hale's Prayer continues over the next scene.

45   INT. MINNIE'S HOUSE -                                               45

     Minnie's wake. Her open casket sits in room off the
     livingroom. She is dressed in her finest Osage traditional
     clothing. A feather sits on her chest. LIZZIE touches her
     hands, her chest, her head, then her own heart and head.

     In the   living room, family and friends milling around the
     house.   Ernest, his wardrobe completely transformed, dressed
     like a   dandy. Bow tie, colorful wardrobe touches, is waiting
     in the   living room.

     Bill Smith comes from the kitchen.

     Ernest and Bill Smith look at each other a little, odd,
     tense.

                           BILL SMITH
                 Ernest would you mind sitting
                 outside?

                           ERNEST
                 Why's that?

                           BILL SMITH

46   EXT. MINNIE'S HOUSE                                              46

     Bill Hale is here with Anna. He slips her a FLASK. She walks
     away. Ernest sits with him.

                         HALE
               It shows itself to you that Bill
               Smith didn't take the care of
               Minnie the way he could have?
               ... To have her sick and die to
               take her headrights and her land?

                           ERNEST
               mm.

                           HALE
               That should go to her sisters, your
               wife... by rights that should go to
               Mollie.
               ...With these women dying, with how
               Osage suffer from illness... you will
               make it the headrights come to you.
               That is sensible and safe, you see?

                           ERNEST
               Yes.

                         HALE
               How is Mollie feeling?

                         ERNEST
               Alright. She takes care of the
               little one...

                         HALE
               That's the Osage way. They'll
               tolerate anybody - even whites -
               for their children. That's their
               riches.

                         ERNEST
               She's sick with diabetes most days,
               you know.

                         HALE
               Yes of course she is. It's just
               waiting on this clock to stop... if
               she's lucky. If not...

                          HALE (CONT'D)
               well suffering is a long, needless
               road... Like it said in Job, "the
               days of affliction have taken hold
               upon her... " This diabetes is a
               trial to bear... Don't have to be
               but it is.

     CU. HALE looks at Ernest.   Ernest looks back, then away...

     down make her comfortable. Young Osage help their Elders get
     food, get comfortable.

                         HALE (V.O.)
               Most Osage don't live past 50, she
               won't last.

               After her... Reta... Anna...
               Then of course, there's Mollie.

                         ERNEST
               Well, Mollie - she's sick but she's
               strong, King.

                         HALE
               I know she's strong now, but
               later... Think of our children. Our
               grandchildren...

     CU. ERNEST listens to all this.

                          HALE (CONT'D)
               Now Anna - Carries a gun in her
               purse for heaven's sake, did you

     Mollie is holding her new baby, JAMES "COWBOY" and blowing
     SMOKE in his ear to soothe an earache. Ernest is with
     Elizabeth. All sitting together. Mollie and Ernest are
     telling an Osage story.

               too young.' She said, "Well, you've
               got a funny face, you got some
               funny looking arms, your tail is
               kind of funny and I really don't
               want to marry you.' And Coyote
               said,`Oh but it would be damaging
               to our reputations if we don't get
               married.' And she said, `Well,
               okay'.

               Then Coyote tried to grab her and
               she took off and picked him up and
               carried him in the air and took him
               far away... and dropped him.
               "There,' she said, `when I say
               something you will remember what I
               said.' And she left, and Coyote
               ended up choking on that dust she
               left behind.


     We see the four of them together as a family. Mollie's voice
     carries over into the next scene.

56   EXT. LIZZIE/MOLLIE'S GRAY HORSE HOME � LATER                          56

     An hour later and Anna pulls up in a cab, gets out and is
     clearly very drunk in the middle of the day...

     Ernest, by a well, sees her wobble up to the house...

                 ANNA                                 ANNA
     Are you laughing?                Ee-thah-xah?

     Not yet... but...                Hahn �kah-zhee...ahn-zhee...

     Mollie, from the window of the house, sees Anna and comes
     out... in OSAGE/ENGLISH MIX:

     They enter and all the Burkharts turn and see the hot-mess of
     Anna. She makes a straight line for Byron...

     Ernest enters the house, watching uncomfortable the whole
     tense interaction that is a mix of Osage/English:

                         BYRON
               Hello, Anna. You steady?


                         ANNA
               I'm pickled. Do you have any
               whiskey?


                         BYRON
               You drank it last night.


                         ANNA
               My man can drink my whiskey --


                         BYRON
               I'm not your man...

                         ANNA
               You maybe don't have a choice...

          You'll do right.

            ERNEST                          ERNEST
You're making threats, Anna.    You're making threats, Anna.

                    BYRON
          I get that feeling.

She smacks him, he laughs a little. Ernest jumps in, Mollie
comes over and ushers her away, it turns messy �

Aunt Annie watching the whole scene, shaking her head.
Things settle.

Byron gets up and moves to get another drink from Martha,
who's scared:

                    BYRON (CONT'D)
              (whispering to her)
          You're so pretty. You know me?

                    MARTHA
          Yes.

                    BYRON
          What do you know?

Anna comes over and starts throwing punches -- Ernest and
Mollie attempting to calm things:

                    ANNA
          Fuck yourself Byron Burkhart.
              (to Martha)
          You want I'll cut you, talking to
          my man?

                    BYRON
          I'm not your man, I'll do as I
          please.

                         ANNA
               If I see you with any woman I will
               kill that woman and then I will
               kill you.

                         BYRON
               You'll have to kill me before I
               kill you.

     Anna goes for the gun in her purse. Ernest stops her and
     pushes Byron out of the house --

                MOLLIE                          MOLLIE

     Byron and Ernest outside, quiet moment smoking a cigarette:

                         BYRON
               Did you hear they found Charlie
               Whitehorn dead?

                          ERNEST
               Ay.   Who did that?

                         BYRON

                         ERNEST
               ...his wife?

                         BYRON
               Most likely.

     PAUSE, THEN, RE: ANNA.

               We will now hear from Paul Red
               Eagle...

                         PAUL RED EAGLE
               The big amounts of money which the
               Osage receive have brought to the
               County a very undesirable class of
               citizens. They are a flock of
               buzzards who steal from us. Some of
               these have married our young women.

     SEE: ERNEST, he looks around.

                         CHIEF BONNICASTLE
               I employ some of them. But I don't
               know if they are really my friends.
               They say they are. Some don't even
               pretend to work. These people are
               bums - ish-tak-hi - white people -
               common vags.

               We cannot depend on the county or
               state officials. We need your help.
               Each member of the tribe is to
               clean up their homes themselves.

               Murder, we're being murdered by
               these ishtakhi. There are so many
               dead now....

     BILL HALE rises and says:

                         BILL HALE
               I'd like to add $1000 to that
               reward for any information about
               these murders. That means if you
               know something about this, you come
               and see me, you all know I'm easy
               to find -

                         CHIEF BONNICASTLE
               Thank you, Mr. Hale. Your
               friendship has always been greatly
               appreciated... I move that we use
               tribal funds to send Mr McBride to
               Washington DC.

                         PAUL RED EAGLE
               I second the motion.

                         CHIEF
               Is Mr. Barney McBride here?...

               travel to Washington D.C. and meet
               with the Indian Affairs Commission
               to ask for investigators and
               additional police in this matter of
               all this death. Do you accept this?

               Your sister Anna leaves an estate
               of approximately $100,000... This

               and you, Mollie, and you, Reta...

                         SCOTT MATHIS
               This is Anna's last annuity. Out of
               respect, in the name of the Big
               Hill Trading Company, Bill Hale has
               waived our fee.

     He hands checks to Bill and Ernest.

               with it, Ernest.
                   (to Mollie)

               Miller Minstrel Show to come and
               play his birthday party. You all

               department has been to Anna's place
               to corroborate Byron's story. I
               stopped by - found her alligator
               purse there, though. Which means
               Byron's not lying - he brought her
               home.

                to us. Ernest, there will not be no
                lightning strike and it stops
                happening. It's going to happen.
                These headrights got to go to
                Mollie. Not to the Mother. Not her
                sister, Reta. Not Bill Smith. Now
                take back control of your house.

101   INT. SHOUN BROTHERS' OFFICE - DAY                               101

      HENRY ROAN is being examined by the two DR SHOUNS.

                          JAMES SHOUN
                How you feeling, Henry?

                           HENRY ROAN
                Good.   Sometimes I feel sad.

                          JAMES SHOUN
                That's not a health issue for us.

                          HALE
                He's fit as a fiddle.

                          DAVID SHOUN
                That he is, Bill. So what are you
                going to do... kill this Indian?

                           HALE
                Yes I am.    No, no, of course not.
                He needs to be insured. It's just a
                formality.

                          HENRY ROAN
                What do I do about my melancholy?

                          JAMES SHOUN
                A little whiskey can help that.

      While Henry Roan dresses, SHOUN talks to HALE.

                          JAMES SHOUN (CONT'D)
                I don't know, Bill, this may not
                look very good. It's hard to
                justify this one, Bill.

                          HALE
                He owes me a lot of money.



102   INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SHOUN BROTHERS' OFFICE                     102

      At the foot of the stairs is a young woman PEARL - a friend
      of Henry's - waiting.

                          HENRY ROAN
                Bill, my guardian won't give me
                what's mine.

                          HALE
                What do you need?
       KOTFM - Final Shooting Script - August 10, 2022   60.


                    HENRY ROAN
          I want to buy some moonshine.

                    PEARL
          C'mon, Henry, let's get going.

They ignore her.

                    HALE
          No, Henry. Henry, you don't need
          that. It's hurting you.

                    HENRY ROAN
          Even the doctor just said I should
          use some.

                    HALE
          Don't mind him, he doesn't know
          what he's talking about.

                    HENRY ROAN
          Uncle, my wife is on Roy Bunch.

                    HALE
          Women are all over you, Henry. Be
          at peace with what you got and
          don't do anything stupid...

                    HENRY ROAN
          I want to hurt myself.

                    HALE
          No, no, no � you're not gonna hurt
          yourself again � that's not a man's
          way out �

                    HENRY ROAN
          A man gets what's his. They won't
          give that to me. A wife's to give
          respect. I don't want to be here
          anymore on this place. I'm
          ashamed... I'm ashamed to be an
          Indian. Get me some moonshine or
          get me a gun.

                    HALE
          Now Henry you go and enjoy yourself
          with Pearl and don't do anything
          stupid.


Henry storms off.

                           HALE (CONT'D)
                     (calling after Roan)
                 I need you, my friend.



103   INT. LIZZIE/MOLLIE'S GRAY HORSE HOME - MOLLIE'S BEDROOM � DAY 103

      CU. MOLLIE, listening to something...

      She is in her back room where she gets her medical
      treatments. She's alone. We hear something outside the
      room, moving feet, shuffling. The door opens and Ernest
      brings the Shoun Brothers in.

      We see this through Mollie's eyes. Her steadiness, paranoia,
      watching each move of everyone in the room.

      It's a silent scene. They get the needle prepared, the
      insulin. Mollie in English/Osage, to Ernest:

                  MOLLIE                           MOLLIE
      Not today now. Turn them         Hahn-pah theh, eh-kee-mahn
      away.                            kohn-brah theen-keh.
                                       Toh-wah-kxah mahn-theen tseh-
                                       ah.

                  ERNEST                           ERNEST
      What?                            Dah-dahn?

                 MOLLIE                            MOLLIE
      I don't want it today.           Eh kohn-bra mahn-zhee hahn-pa
                                       theh.

                  ERNEST                            ERNEST
      ...but they're Doctors.          ... wah-kahn-dah-kee eh ah-
                                       kxah..

                 MOLLIE                           MOLLIE
      Not today now.                   Hahn-pah theh, hahn-kah-zhee

                 ERNEST                           ERNEST
      It's the Shouns, they're the     Shouns eh ah-kxah, wah-kahn-
      doctors.                         dah-kee eh ah-kxah.

                 MOLLIE                            MOLLIE
      Turn them away.                  Toh-wah-kxah mahn-theen tseh-
                                       ah.

      CU. ERNEST hesitates, thinks, then:

                           ERNEST
                 Fellas, can you stand outside for
                 me please while I speak to my wife?
             KOTFM - Final Shooting Script - August 10, 2022        62.


      They leave.   Mollie to Ernest:

                 MOLLIE                            MOLLIE
      I don't like them. I don't        Weh-ah-see eh, weh-ah-nahn-he-
      believe them.                     mahn-zhee meen-ksheh.



                  ERNEST                            ERNEST
      You can't be the Doctor. We       Thee-eh wah-kahn-dah-kee nee-
      need the shots and insulin.       eh shtsoots'-ah-keh.
      What then, Mollie?                Insulin oh-weh-peh-tseh ahn-
                                        kohn-thah ah-kxah-een. Kah-
                                        thohn hee-ah-nahn, Mollie?

                  MOLLIE                            MOLLIE
      I'll take it from you. I          Shtseh-ahn-thah-theh ah-kshee-
      don't want it from them, turn     theh tseh. Kah-tseh wah-kohn-
      them away.                        bra mahn-zhee, doh-wah-kxah
                                        mahn-theen tseh-ah.



104   ERNEST, THINKS, GOES OUTSIDE, FINDS THEM ON THE PORCH. THE        104
      KIDS HAVE FOLLOWED HIM OUTSIDE.

                          ERNEST
                So fellas, give me that. I'll do
                it.

                          JAMES SHOUN
                You're administering the shot?

                           ERNEST
                Yes.

                          DAVID SHOUN
                Oh Ernest, Bill Hale has entrusted
                us with this care -

                          ERNEST
                (interrupting) - I know. I know.
                Just give me that and get going!


                          DAVID SHOUN
                We're still going to have to charge
                you for this visit.

                          JAMES SHOUN
                We made the trip out here. Gas,
                time.
              KOTFM - Final Shooting Script - August 10, 2022        63.


                          ERNEST
                You're going to charge me for this
                robbery? Oh, J Grover Cripes just
                give me that -

      He grabs the INSULIN (BOX), heads back inside the house � the
      kids follow him.



105   INSIDE: ERNEST SAYS TO MOLLIE...                                   105

                          ERNEST
                You made me send the doctors away.
                The doctors! Are you a doctor? Am I
                a doctor? ...Stupid stubborn bitch
                let those men do their work.

                 MOLLIE                                MOLLIE
      Give it to me.                     Ahnk'oo-eh.

      Ernest settles and sits down, gets the shot and the insulin
      ready. She lifts her blouse and he gives her the insulin
      shot.

                  MOLLIE (CONT'D)                    MOLLIE (CONT'D)
      We don't need them.                Eh ahn-wah-kohn-thah-pah-zhee

                          ERNEST
                So I'm the doctor - and the nurse -
                and God knows what all!

                          MOLLIE
                It's not helping... it's not good.

                          ERNEST
                    (holding the vial)
                It's new. King Hale is gifting you
                with this! Only five people in the
                whole world are getting this. Give
                it a chance. Maybe it's got to get
                worse before it gets better. Think
                you know everything with your
                Indian ways. You think someone's
                going to hurt you?

                           MOLLIE
                ...

                          ERNEST
                You don't say something to that?
                    (caressing her)
                I'm to take care of you, no one
                will hurt you when I'm in front.

106   INT. ROY BUNCH BUTCHER SHOP - DAY                             106

      Roan attacking ROY BUNCH (white, grinding sausage) with a
      club across the back of his head.

                          HENRY ROAN
                Get off my wife!

      MARY ROAN, Henry's wife, comes in and separates them.

                          ROY BUNCH
                I've done nothing to you!



107   INT. BANK/FAIRFAX - DAY                                       107

      Bank doors open and BANK MANAGER let's in Bill & Ernest �
      Pearl is right there with the Bank Manager.

                          BANK MANAGER
                There he is - right over there...

      Pearl follows Hale and Ernest.

                          HENRY ROAN (O.C.)
                I'm tired of asking friends for
                things when I can pay my own way.

      Henry is standing shouting at a BANK EMPLOYEE.

                          HENRY ROAN (CONT'D)
                Who tells you how to spend your
                money? I'm tired of coming in here
                begging. (cursing) Oh-shkee-kah
                thah-ee(n)-sheh!

      Hale gets him.

                          HALE
                Ee-aahh, Henry! Thi-shdan, Henry! I
                told you not to do anything stupid!
                You went and hit Roy Bunch!

                          HENRY ROAN
                I knocked him down, Reverend Hale,
                I knocked him.

                          HALE
                Calm down, thoo-shtaka. Come on,
                kyu. On-ga-the-tse. Let's get out
                of here.
             KOTFM - Final Shooting Script - August 10, 2022          65.


      Hale and Ernest help an almost collapsing Roan - Hale hands
      Roan to Ernest and Pearl who take him toward the door. Hale
      turns and admonishes everyone in the bank -

                          HALE (CONT'D)
                WHO IS LETTING THIS MAN DOWN IN A
                TIME OF NEED? `LEST WE LOOK THE
                OTHER WAY FROM A MAN IN DESPERATE
                TIMES??? SHAME ON US.



108   INT. HALE RANCH/LIVING ROOM � MOMENTS LATER                      108

      Hale and Ernest lay Roan on the floor.

                          ERNEST
                Why do you take care of him?

                          HALE
                He's a melancholic. Do you know he
                tried to do away with himself last
                year?

      They lay him out on the floor, catch their breath.

                          ERNEST
                    (nods, yes)

                          HALE
                I take care of that man because
                he's my best friend and my
                neighbor. And that's $25,000
                dollars lying there. I've got an
                insurance policy on him against
                what he owes me. If he succeeds in
                demising himself before the end of
                the year I forfeit. He needs to
                stay alive at least one more
                year... And I might even have a
                chance at his headrights...

                                                           CUT TO:



109   ERNEST & HALE SITTING IN THE NEXT ROOM. HAVING A DRINK.          109

                          HALE
                Something you should know...
                Mollie's first husband is that man
                right there on the floor. She
                didn't tell you?
             KOTFM - Final Shooting Script - August 10, 2022       66.


                          ERNEST
                No.

                          HALE
                Osage don't divorce.


                          ERNEST
                So she's still married to him?

                          HALE
                No. No. Traditional. They were
                fifteen. But it's all passed now.

                          ERNEST
                She lied to me?

                          HALE
                How does she treat you?

                          ERNEST
                She's a good one.

                          HALE
                So it doesn't matter what happened
                before...

                          ERNEST
                She can't be lying to me.

                          HALE
                Let her have her secrets. That way
                you can have yours.

       pointing to the East Side of the room. Two candles are
       already out.

                           TREASURER (PITTS BEATY)
                 His pure and lofty lessons were
                 intended to insure the happiness of
                 mankind; but those whom he would
                 fain have served knew him not, and
                 put him to death.

       TREASURER takes his finger and extinguishes the third light.

      great Cowboy's career in roping, bull riding, etc. This is
      for HENRY GRAMMER - a movie-star in this world also runs a
      distillery, main booze supplier to Osage County.

                          HALE (V.O.)
                Look at all this blue! It's like
                looking at the sea. Or the ocean.
                Is that gold?

                          HENRY GRAMMER (V.O.)
                That's better than gold.

      Working Distillery. Hale and Ernest pay a vist to Grammer.
      Ernest having to watch Hale treat Grammer like a son and a
      rock star.

                          HENRY GRAMMER
                ...That's recognition.

                          HALE (TO ERNEST)
                This man knows what it's like to be
                the best at what you do.

      Time cut - they're all drinking at a table nearby.

                          HALE (CONT'D)
                Henry what I want is someone who
                can do a job, who can take a
                proposition to do an old man and
                his blanket. Now I just don't want
                any man because this has to be done
                right, I need them both to go at
                the same time. So it's not going
                to be poison whiskey but something
                else that is fool proof.

      Grammer calls JOHN RAMSEY (50s, ranchhand, white, skinny).
      Grammer hands him a bottle.

                          HENRY GRAMMER
                John! Go stash this in the house
                and don't let Maggie see you.

      Ramsey takes the bottle.

                    RAMSEY
          Oh now - she's got eyes, Henry. She
          caught me last time and I -

                    HENRY GRAMMER
          Give it to me!

Ramsey goes back to the distillery.

                    HENRY GRAMMER (CONT'D)
          What good is it to have a man who
          can't do what I tell him. (pause)

He turns to Hale.

                    HENRY GRAMMER (CONT'D)
          Why don't you talk to Blackie
          Thompson?

                    ERNEST
          He's in penitentiary right now -

                    HALE
          (interrupting) - because you made a
          stupid move and had him nabbed for
          Insurance Money on his car �

                    HENRY GRAMMER
          That's bad luck. What about Kelsie
          Morrison?

                    HALE
          Kelsie's gone soft on me right
          now...

                    ERNEST
          He's down in Mexico, last I
          heard... There's Dick Gregg.

                    HENRY GRAMMER
          No - he's wanted in Arkansas, he's
          wanted in Kansas - he's so hid he
          can't find himself -- you need a
          yegg man, someone if you want
          explosives that can make it sure
          you get them both � soup under the
          house, nitro or dynamite to blow
          `em up �

          I think that's Acie Kirby ...

          ...Hey John, where's Acie Kirby
          these days?

                 I don't rightly know where he is,
                 he's hiding in his hole.

                 Anna � he said they're helping to
                 take the lazy men away from town.

                           HALE
                 mmmhmm. Well, Pitts and his Klan
                 are trying to have authority here,
                 and they have none. They need to
                 let the Police Force do their work
                 � I am very disapproving of the Ku
                 Klux Klan, Mollie, they're very
                 hungry for a power --

                           MOLLIE

                          HALE
                You should be more careful how
                you're spending that money of
                Mollie's, Ernest... and you buying
                a farm... Consult with me before

                 married to her... but I don't take
                 chances...I'm seeing to it... I'm
                 seeing to it.

      ERNEST sees the threat.

      Ernest with Ramsey.
             KOTFM - Final Shooting Script - August 10, 2022         75.


                          ERNEST
                Ramsey, I know you're in bad way in
                this life, you have very hard
                circumstances, you've got lots of
                kids, seven or eight I heard...?

                          JOHN RAMSEY
                Yah, I got a passel of `em.

                          ERNEST
                I've got a job to get you out of
                the bind you're in. King Bill Hale
                wants to know if you'd like a job
                getting someone done?

                          JOHN RAMSEY
                That's not what I do. I can't do
                that.

                          ERNEST
                It's an Indian.

                          JOHN RAMSEY
                ...that's different.

                          ERNEST
                You know Henry Roan?

                          JOHN RAMSEY
                I don't know him.

                          ERNEST
                ...what do you think?

      LONG PAUSE.

                          ERNEST (CONT'D)
                I'm going to take you right now and
                buy you a Roadster so you can drive
                around and do this for him. There
                won't be no rumble over this
                killing. The Injun's a melancholic -
                Hale's going around saying he tried
                twice already, so he wants you make
                it like he did it himself... in the
                front of the head. Understand?

                Hey Ernest!

      We see Ernest and Ramsey go into the cafe.

                          RAMSEY (V.O.)
                So Ernest had me meet this Indian
                at a restaurant in Fairfax and he
                sat down beside me and I smelled
                whiskey on his breath.

      Through the front window we see Ramsey be introduced to Henry
      Roan. (Sit at counter and have a meal.) THROUGH THE WINDOW we
      see them at the counter.

      a jug down a disused oil well.

                          RAMSEY (V.O.)
                I told him I could sell him some. I
                told him to meet me out on the road
                running through Sol Smith's pasture
                about 10 o'clock and I would meet
                him and have the whiskey for him.

      Roan and Ramsey drinking with Mrs. Mackie and A HOOKER. Roan
      has his arm around her. She is cutting cocaine from a giant
      rock of coke (not partaking of cocaine).

                          RAMSEY (V.O.)
                A few times after that I met this
                Indian. And we got to like one
                another - what with his troubles
                being respected and all...
                Sometimes we go to Mrs Mackie's
                Place.

                          MRS. MACKIE
                So he took it! Imagine that! What
                kind of sheriff goes around selling
                cocaine? You tell me that.

                          RAMSEY (V.O.)
                ...This went on for awhile. I was
                trying to rib up a little more
                courage and one day I decided to
                pull the job everything being
                favorable. So I told this Indian we
                get a jug and some girls and meet
                me on the road running through
                Smith's pasture.

      They drink.

      Roan and Ramsey at a secret stash spot in Sol Smith's
      pasture. Roan stays in the car, behind the wheel. Ramsey
      gets the booze, walks it back and hands it to Roan...

      Ramsey gets the nerve, walks around the front of the car...
      then walks around the back of the car, gets up on the
      standing board, and SHOOTS HENRY ROAN IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD
      AS HE'S DRINKING.

      John Ramsey walks back to his car...

                          ERNEST
                I don't know. Pawhuska.

                          JOHN RAMSEY
                Tell him it's done �

                          ERNEST
                You did it where?

                          JOHN RAMSEY
                It's done out at the road off Sol
                Smith's pasture and that's it...
                I'm gonna give you the gun...

      CU. MOLLIE'S REACTION.

      Ernest watching her closely to see her reaction,
      scrutinizing.

                          MOLLIE
                Did he kill himself?

                          ERNEST
                Don't know.

                          MOLLIE
                He was always sad. Always.

                          ERNEST
                You know him well?

                          MOLLIE
                Since we were children.

                His wife is not true to him I don't
                think.

                Does your Uncle know? They were
                friends.

                            ERNEST
                Yes.

                          MOLLIE
                He wasn't murdered was he?

                            ERNEST
                No.

                          MOLLIE
                He tried to kill himself last year.
                Did you know that?

                             ERNEST
                       (nods, yes)

                          MOLLIE
                Was he murdered? Or did he kill
                himself? Do you know?

                          ERNEST
                Roy Bunch made a lot of noise about
                wanting to kill him. He was on his
                wife. So you don't have to look too
                far. Maybe he killed himself, like
                you say... I don't know.

      Mollie looks. Then walks into her room and closes the door.

      Ernest waiting in his car outside Hale's Ranch.   Hale bursts
      out of his house, angry, heads to the car --

                          HALE
                I told you to do it in the front of
                the head.

                I don't know why he didn't.

                          HALE
                Why did he do that?

                          ERNEST
                I don't know. I told him. I told
                him.



138   EXT. FAIRFAX/ERNEST'S CAR � DRIVING � NIGHT               138

      Ernest and Hale, driving, arguing:

                          HALE
                And you told him proper? How do I
                know you told him right?

                          ERNEST
                I'll get him right now and put him
                in front of you to tell you what I
                told him � I didn't do this wrong.
                He did it wrong. He's a coward,
                couldn't do it in the face like you
                said. I promise you. I swear on my
                children.

                          HALE
                Don't do that. Settle down. Settle.
                There's no problem that can't be
                fixed. Now it's too much murder.
                Don't swear on your children, that
                makes you look foolish.

                          ERNEST
                I'm not foolish because I did it
                right. John Ramsey is your man and
                he's a shuckle head and he didn't
                have the nerve to do it in his
                face. I'll find him and make him
                tell you.

                          HALE
                You settle down, settle down,

                This isn't the place for you to be.
                And I have a line that says you
                should leave town because Sheriff's
                office is looking to charge you in
                this killing � they know you were
                on shooting terms �

                If I run, I'm guilty and I've got
                nothing to be guilty about.

                If you don't run, you're going to
                go to prison for this, you did it
                or not � this is my friendly word.

                 Thank you, Bill but no, I don't
                 think I will. And you're not my
                 friend. I'll take my chances right
                 here in Fairfax.

                    RETA
          (confidentially) I'm gonna protect
          you. I changed my will.


                    MOLLIE
          You can't outrun what's coming,
          Reta. If they want to get us...

                    RETA
          Yes, I know, but why are you
          helping them?

                    MOLLIE
          Who?

                    RETA
          Who it is that's doing these
          killings. Sometimes I think
          someone's put medicine on you...
          How are you being taken care of,
          Mollie?

                    MOLLIE
          I have Ernest and my children.
          Ernest takes good care of me.

                    RETA
          I don't want to be scared. Why
          don't we just leave? Go to Colorado
          Springs. Why are we staying here?

                    MOLLIE
          This is home.

Reta looks to the other room and Ernest and Bill, looks back
to Mollie. Ernest looks back and sees Reta's eyes for a
flash.

                    BILL SMITH
          So you and Mollie stayin' in town
          now, too, huh?

                      ERNEST
          ...yea. Pretty much. We're here now.
          [Beat] You made yourself a nice
          place here.

                    BILL SMITH
          Yeah, the Shoun brothers gave us a
          sweet deal. Left us some nice
          things here, too. [Beat] Not as
          nice as you've been buying, but
          it's enough for us.

          Mollie likes nice things.

                    BILL SMITH
          Not as much as you...

Ernest stares at him.

                    BILL SMITH (CONT'D)
          ...you need a drink?

                    ERNEST
          You have some?

                    BILL SMITH
          No.

                    ERNEST
          Then why you asking?

                    BILL SMITH
          You seem nervous.

                     ERNEST
          I got no nerves. I don't really
          like talking to you, Bill. That's
          mostly it.

                    BILL SMITH
          Am I doing something to bother you,
          Ernest?

                    ERNEST
          Just the way you are bothers me.

                    BILL SMITH
          Nothin' I can do about that.

                    ERNEST
          No there isn't.

                    BILL SMITH
          Lest you kill me. Maybe that's your
          brother's job.

                    ERNEST
          Maybe you stick around long enough
          I'll get a chance at you, Bill...

                    BILL SMITH
          You do your own work?

                where to find Acie Kirby, where
                does he stay?

                  Well, I can't go right now, my
                  wife's sick.

                  My wife's sick too! Just tell her
                  you gotta go out to Grammer's for

                            JOHN RAMSEY
                  Why aren't you doing this? Why are
                  you always getting someone else to
                  do your work?

                            ERNEST
                  I don't know Acie Kirby. I don't
                  even know what he looks like. I
                  would do it, but I can't do it
                  because I don't know what he looks
                  like. I'm sorry.

                              ERNEST
                  So   you know, it's something should
                  be   done straight away, not to wait
                  on   it for Hale, you see? It has to
                  be   done straight away.

                            JOHN RAMSEY
                  You're pushy, Ernest. I'll do it,
                  I'll do it. I gotta get back to
                  work...

                That's a hard trip for an ailing
                woman, Mollie. It didn't go so well
                with Ernest as your guardian, did
                it?... I am now reinstated as your
                guardian and I can't let you have
                this money or make this trip,
                Mollie, that would do a disservice
                to you and your children.

154   EXT. TRAIN PLATFORM � FAIRFAX � MORNING                         154

      The Osage Delegation is leaving to head to Washington D.C.

      Ernest helps Mollie towards the steps of the train. Another
      member of the Delegation helps her up into the train. She
      waves goodbye to Ernest and the children...

      It's a photo op for PRESIDENT COOLIDGE and the Osage Tribe.
      Mollie standing next to the President.

      The photograph is taken and President Coolidge moves away,
      Mollie and the Tribe's INTERPRETER grab his attention:

                          MOLLIE
                Mr. President, please send someone
                to help us. There is murder in
                Osage and the police do nothing
                about this. I lost my sisters and
                mother and we have Osage killed for
                the oil money.

      He nods and nods and nods and then is ushered away.

                Give her some of this (indicating
                the vial)... and this (indicating a
                different vial). That's this whole
                vial. Make sure the balance is
                right.

                 Now you keep the shots regular.

       Ernest reacts. Doctors occupy themselves (organizing vials
       for Ernest to take home?) As Hale talks to Ernest privately.

                           HALE
                 It's just to slow her down...
                 (repeats?: It's just to slow her
                 down... ) It's not going to hurt
                 her.

       Ernest looks.

                           HALE (CONT'D)
                 She's gone to Washington - you know
                 what that means for us?... For
                 you?... We don't have a choice,
                 son.

       Ernest still resisting.

                           HALE (CONT'D)
                 You believe in the Bible? The
                 miracles of old?

                           ERNEST
                 Yeah.. yeah..

                           HALE
                 You expecting a miracle to make all
                 this go away? They don't happen
                 anymore. We make the miracles...
                 You're not going anywhere, Ernest.

                been given bad whiskey... poisoned.
                There are so many deaths.

      A band is playing � through the band we see an OLDER OSAGE
      COUPLE moving through the dancers with JOHN WREN (part-Ute)
      bringing him to meet a few Osage Council Members who are
      chatting with Mollie's Catholic Priest. At first cautious,
      Wren then receives a warm welcome.

                          OSAGE COUPLE
                This here's John Wren. Friend of
                cousin Mary. He's come looking for
                family.

                          COUNCIL MEMBER
                Welcome. [Asks a Question]

                          JOHN WREN
                I've been told I have Osage
                relations in Hominy. Mary was kind
                enough to take me in.

                          COUNCIL MEMBER
                Where are you from, [MORE] etc.

      Ernest rushes through them as they're speaking acting frantic
      and skittish to report news of Tom White. Hale has just
      finished dancing, out of breath, taking a seat. Ernest grabs
      Bill Hale tries to take him to the side.

      Hale agitated sees his manner and tells him to stop and
      settle himself.

      Things get heated. Hale loses his cool and grabs him by the
      back of the neck like a child and squeezes, pushes him down,
      pushes his face into his own knees.   This is noticed by some
      people. The couple with John Wren and the Council member(s)
      witness it. It's over as soon as it started, Hale hoping to
      make it all go away.

      Ernest settles down, says a few words more but is cut off by
      Hale walking away, getting back on the dance floor and
      finding Myrtie. He seems concerned. Ernest leaves.

      Hale looking over his cattle. He seems pre-occupied, seems to

      He is introduced to CJ ROBINSON (white, 30s). They shake

                Have you seen the lights burning in

                          TOM WHITE
                I have.

                Why are you here now?

                          TOM WHITE

                          PAUL RED EAGLE
                Is that because McBride was

                          CHIEF BONNICASTLE
                In the old days we would fight
                these people. Twenty years ago I
                fought overseas in The Boxer
                Rebellion. I was one of the first
                to climb over that Great Wall. I
                knew who my enemy was and I knew
                who I had to kill. If we could find
                these people we would fight them.
                But now this invisible enemy we
                cannot see. We can't trust any of
                the local officials. We can't trust
                the state government. We can't
                trust the Bureau of Affairs
                officials. We can't trust our
                neighbor. We can't trust the local
                pastor. We can't trust the morgue,
                the morticians, funeral homes. We
                can't trust you. We can't trust
                anybody. We don't see any stop.

                You'll have to argue that out with

                I'm just telling you if we wire

   I think you need to see the Justice
   of the Peace, he has the inquest
   records about Anna Brown's death.

             JOHN BURGER
   -- Those records have gone missing
   from his desk �

   So then you need the Undertaker
   Turton, he's all the details you
   might need, he kept the skull -

             JOHN BURGER
   Seen him too and that's what brings
   us to you � possible you lost the
   bullet that killed her?

             JAMES SHOUN
   Well no, because we never found it.

             FRANK SMITH
   That's why you were tearing up the
   brain, looking for the bullet?

             JAMES SHOUN
   Yes that's right. The condition of
   the corpse was so bad because she
   had been dead for five or six
   days. Then we exhumed her.

             FRANK SMITH
   Why did you cut the body up into
   small pieces and cleave the flesh
   from the limbs with a meat ax?

             DAVID SHOUN
   We were looking for the bullet.

             FRANK SMITH
   Ah huh.

             DAVID SHOUN
   You know, this is really a matter
   for the Indian Tribal Council, you
   should see Chief Bonnicastle.

             FRANK SMITH
   What's he going to tell me?

                I've only just been assigned to

                No, sir. By J. Edgar Hoover.

                Well, I don't know him.

                I heard you're the King of the
                Osage Hills - so you might be the
                man to talk to.

                          HALE
                mm... seems to me... this murder
                in the air is at the hand of most
                likely a band of men from outside
                these parts. Possibly negroes. (You
                saw what happened in Tulsa.) No
                proof - just my hunch.


                Then there's just bad luck - Anna
                Brown - nasty mouth. Henry Roan?
                Melancholic you know. Charlie
                Whitehorn? Now he was a great

                          TOM WHITE
                What about the other dead Osage?
                Joe Grayhorse? Joe Bates... 25, 30
                we keep counting... Seems like
                you've got one hell of an epidemic

       THE FIRE. Silhouettes, moving around, like Demons.

                            TOM WHITE (V.O.)
                  Ernest Burkhart is skittish, he is
                  afraid. He drinks and displays a
                  nervous temper. It is in my opinion
                  that he could be made to tell the
                  truth...

       Ernest turns into his house...



A199   INT. CELLAR MOLLIE'S FAIRFAX HOME                               A199

       Ernest mixes up something with the vials (and whiskey?) in
       the cellar and drinks it.

199    INT. MOLLIE'S FAIRFAX HOME � NIGHT                               199

       Mollie sees the flicker of fire on the ceiling of her sick
       room. She closes her eyes.

       Ernest is drunk and out of it. He shoots her up - injecting
       her... with two bottles.

       Ernest takes a vial and adds it to a whiskey (or drinks it
       from the vial). He sees flames like demons on the wall. He
       walks toward the flames...

       Mollie flickers her eyes open for a moment. Sees him, doesn't
       see him.

                            MOLLIE (TO ERNEST)
                  You're next.

      Ernest hanging out at his pool hall when suddenly: Tom White,
      Frank Smith and John Burger come in to arrest him � they have
      brought the local OSAGE COUNTY SHERIFF as The Bureau can't
      arrest anyone or carry guns at this time...

                          ERNEST
                Here we go, then... you got this
                all wrong. I have to go home, I
                have to go home and see my wife...
                she's sick and I have to take care
                of her...

      Ernest tries some side-steps around pool tables and pretends
      they're not even there, until they are upon him and handcuff
      him...

                Can I sit down?

                          FRANK SMITH
                Standing is good.

                          TOM WHITE
                We want to talk to you about the

203   CU. ERNEST IT'S MANY HOURS LATER, IT'S NIGHT. HE'S STILL       203
      STANDING IN THE SAME SPOT, HE LOOKS EXHAUSTED. SILENCE,
      THEN:

                          ERNEST
                I need to sit down.

                          TOM WHITE
                Yes you do but you're standing.

                          ERNEST
                I need some sleep.

                          TOM WHITE
                Were you alone when you put the
                explosives under the house? Was
                Blackie Thompson with you?

                          ERNEST
                He was no where around me, because
                I don't even know him so much �
                just from around.

                          TOM WHITE
                You didn't rob a bank in Oilton
                with him did you?

                          ERNEST
                I never did that.

                          TOM WHITE
                You didn't have a bunkhouse with
                stolen cars where men could stay?
                Cook stove? Place to eat? Beds?

                          ERNEST
                Not that I know of.

                          TOM WHITE
                You did help Blackie Thompson steal
                your own Buick car in 1921 for the
                purpose of collecting insurance on
                it, didn't you?

                          ERNEST
                I told him he could take the car.

                For the purpose of using it?

                          ERNEST
                I don't know what he wanted it for.

                          TOM WHITE
                You loaned it to him.

                          ERNEST
                ...what, what, what is all this? I
                loaned him my car, that's not
                against the law.

                How you doing, Ernest?

      CU. ERNEST: Silence, then...

                          ERNEST
                May I speak to this man? Alone?

                          TOM WHITE
                You want to speak to him alone?

                          ERNEST
                Yes.

      They all leave the room.

                          BLACKIE THOMPSON
                They got you turned around?

                          ERNEST
                No. What did you tell them?

                          BLACKIE THOMPSON
                I told them when I came back from
                prison to see you to make things
                right, you gave me $1.50 and you
                told me, "Well, we all knew the
                chances we were taking..."

                          ERNEST
                We did. But I gave you a twenty.

                No you didn't. You gave me a dollar
                fifty.

                           ERNEST
                I gave you a twenty. I meant to
                give you a twenty. What did you
                tell them?

                          BLACKIE THOMPSON
                All of it. I told them you and
                your Uncle are too much Jew. I'm
                doing life for killing that
                Drumright cop and I'm telling you
                now, Ernest - I know you can't do
                time in prison. So tell them what

                You're a good man, Ernest and you
                love your wife and children. You
                served your country in Infantry and
                I don't think this is how your life
                was meant to turn out � I see your
                family is more of a blessing than
                your King Bill Hale. He's done
                nothing but taken advantage of
                your human nature and forced you
                into doing bad things.

                          ERNEST
                I want to go back home to my wife,

                Bill Hale and Ernest Burkhart have

      Ernest sees Hale at the defendant's table with his lawyers.
      Hale looks at Ernest.

      Tom White and John Wren take a seat and look at the all white
      jury. He sees the Judge, HONORABLE JOHN C. POLLOCK.

      Ernest takes the stand, everyone falls quiet for one second
      and then, suddenly:

      W.S. HAMILTON (Hale's Lawyer) stands up and stops all this
      before it starts by screaming out:

                          W.S. HAMILTON
                I demand to confer privately with
                Mr. Burkhart. He is my client.

      Loud objections, minor chaos, then, Ernest looks baffled,
      everyone does:

                          W.S. HAMILTON (CONT'D)
                ERNEST BURKHART IS MY CLIENT AND I
                DEMAND AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH

                MONTHS AND I HAVE NOT HAD THE
                CHANCE TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM
                BEFORE HE TESTIFIES!

                contract with him but I'm willing
                to talk to him.


      More objections from prosecution, Tom White and Wren look on
      as the courtroom goes nuts.

      W.S. Hamilton and Hale's team of lawyers get Ernest into a
      back room.

                          MOLLIE
                Yes, Ernest. I had to get worse
                before I got better.
                ...What's going to come now?

                          ERNEST
                Well, Mollie... it's very
                complicated.

                          MOLLIE
                No, it shouldn't be.

                          ERNEST
                Yes, I know. But white man's laws
                are hard to understand... sometimes
                you have to do one thing even
                though you mean the other thing �
                and I know that's hard for you to
                understand as Osage. So what I have
                to do is to go now and tell the
                real Truth about what these
                government men have done to make me
                lie to them... you see they beat me
                and tortured me so that I would say
                that my Uncle did these things...
                but now I am in my right way... and
                I cannot tell that lie about him.
                So I am going to do the right thing
                now and protect him.

                          MOLLIE
                When will you come back?

                over. They have to arrest me just
                for a show of it. But I'm not in

KELSIE MORRISON is on the stand.

                    PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
          ... how did you come to kill Anna
          Brown?

                    KELSIE
          I was hired by W.K. Hale.

                    PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
          What did he say to you?

                    KELSIE
          I was to get a thousand dollars and
          the money I owed him which was six
          hundred dollars.

                    PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
          Now you say you killed Anna Brown?

                       KELSIE
          Yes, sir.

                    PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
          You took her down into that canyon
          there into what was commonly known
          as the Three Mile Canyon, didn't
          you?

                       KELSIE
          Yes, sir.

                    PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
          What did you shoot her with?

                       KELSIE
          Automatic.

                    PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
          And where did you shoot her?

                    KELSIE
          Shot her down through the top of
          the head, I guess I killed her.

                    PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
          Now you say you were pretty drunk?

                       KELSIE
          Yes, sir.

                    PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
          You knew you were killing her
          didn't you?

               KELSIE
   Yes sir.

             PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
   How did you get her down to the
   place where you killed her?

             KELSIE
   Byron and I carried her down there.

             PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
   Did you make her drunk so you could
   kill her?

               KELSIE
   Yes, sir.

             PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
   Was she laying down when you killed
   her?

               KELSIE
   No, sir.

             PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
   What position was she in?

             KELSIE
   Sitting up. Byron raised her up,
   pulled her up and held her up.

             PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
   You stood there and directed him
   how to hold this drunken helpless
   Indian woman down in the bottom of
   that canyon while you got ready to
   shoot a bullet into her brain?

               KELSIE
   Yes, sir.

             PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
   What happened when you shot her?

             KELSIE
   Turned her loose and she fell back
   down.

             PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
   Did she make any outcry?

               KELSIE
   No, sir.

          die?

                      KELSIE
          No, sir.

                    PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
          You were satisifed with your work?

                      KELSIE
          Yes, sir.

                    PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
          Then you turned and left.

                      KELSIE
          Yes, sir.

                    PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
          Have you seen that canyon where you
          killed Anna Brown?

                    KELSIE
          I have seen it a hundred times, I
          suppose.

                    PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
          You have seen it a hundred times
          since? You wanted to go back and
          see where you killed Anna Brown?

                      KELSIE
          No, sir.

                      PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
          Well?

                      KELSIE
          No, sir.

                    PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
          What did you go back out there for?

Kelsie smiles.

                    PROSECUTOR LEAWARD (CONT'D)
          Go ahead and tell the jury.

                    KELSIE

          and drink and put on parties � it
          can't be seen from the road......

                    ERNEST
          It's the Federal Government.

                    HALE
          That's right - it's the Federal
          government. That's why I say that.

Pauses. Let's Ernest reflect.

                    HALE (CONT'D)
          All that's really going to happen
          is the family is going to be broke
          up. Is that what you want?

             HALE (CONT'D)
   It's just not going to make any
   difference. I tell you this from
   the deepest part of my heart.

             ERNEST
   People have turned. They've seen a
   dark streak through the country.
   It's different now, Bill - the
   Osage -

             HALE
   (interrupts) - The Osage know. They
   know who gave them the schools -
   the streets they walk on... I've
   brought them into the great 20th
   century. What have you done -
   you've created a family with my
   help - because of me.

              ERNEST
   They're not going to stand by you,
   Bill. Not now - it's over - after
   all this -

             HALE
   No, they will, they will - Oh there
   might be some public outcry `for
   awhile' but then people will
   forget. They won't even remember -
   they won't even care. Nothing's
   gonna change, son, it's just gonna
   be another "everyday"... common
   tragedy.

             ERNEST
   ... common, huh?...

             HALE
   If it's the last thing you hear me
   tell you - please don't do
   something you're gonna regret for
   the rest of your life.

             ERNEST
   Regret? Regret?! I got nothing but
   regrets. I regret now that I should
   have done this earlier.

             HALE
   You really believe you'll be better
   off after you do what you think you
   ought to do? - you're gonna go on
   living like nothing happened?

                I thank you, Bill, but I gotta look
                after my family... I can't -

      Ernest backs away.

             PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
   Mr. Burkhart, is this of your own
   accord?

               ERNEST
   Yes sir.

             PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
   No one has promised you anything?

               ERNEST
   No sir.

             PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
   Did you seek out John Ramsey at
   your Uncle's behest to kill Henry
   Roan?

               ERNEST
   Yes sir.

             PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
   Did you drive from Fairfax to
   Ripley to tell John Ramsey to tell
   Asa Kirby to do a job?

               ERNEST
   Yes, sir.

             PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
   Who asked you to do this?

             ERNEST
   My Uncle William Hale.

             PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
   Do you see him?

               ERNEST
   Yes, sir.

             PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
   Can you point to him?

             ERNEST
   Yes, sir, right there.

             PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
   I'd ask that the record reflect the
   witness identified the Defendant,
   Mr. Hale.

             JUDGE POLLOCK
   The record shall so reflect.


             PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
   What was the job that he wanted Asa
   Kirby to do?

             ERNEST
   He wanted to blow up Reta and Bill
   Smith.

             PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
   Why would he want them blown up?

             ERNEST
   So to get their money.

             PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
   Are you a married man?

               ERNEST
   Yes, sir.

             PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
   What is your wife's name?

             ERNEST
   Mollie Burkhart.

             PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
   She is Reta's sister?

               ERNEST
   Yes, sir.

             PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
   She is also the sister of Anna
   Brown who was murdered.

               ERNEST
   Yes.

             PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
   And her mother Lizzie Q who is
   dead?

               ERNEST
   Yes.

             PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
   And her sister Minnie is dead?

                    ERNEST
          Yes.

                    PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
          And all these dead women are Indian
          women, are they?

                    ERNEST
          Yes.

                    PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
          If Mollie, your wife, died, who
          would get her Oil Money?

                    ERNEST
          Me and our children.

                    PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
          Did your Uncle lay out a plan to you
          by which you would benefit from the
          deaths of all these Indian women?

                    ERNEST
          ...yes, sir.

                    PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
          And you helped your Uncle on your
          own making?

                    ERNEST
          Yes.

                    PROSECUTOR LEAWARD
          Was part of this plan that you
          would meet and marry Mollie Kyle?
          And kill her family and her for
          their Indian Oil Money?

                    ERNEST
          No, sir. I met and married my wife
          because I picked her up in my cab.

                    PROSECUTOR LEAWARD (O.C.)
          You did not marry her because your
          Uncle directed you to?

                    ERNEST
          No, sir. I loved my wife from
          because that's what happened to us
          when I picked her up in my cab.

          Ernest was sent back to prison.
          Years later he was granted a Pardon
          for his crimes and once again,
          moved back to Osage County, just
          outside Fairfax where he lived out
          his days with Byron in a trailer
          park north of the city.

          lived with her new husband John
          Cobb on the Reservation. She died
          of diabetes on June 16, 1937. Her

       A RADIO SHOW PRODUCER reads the obituary...

                            RADIO SHOW PRODUCER
                 "Mrs. Mollie Cobb, 50 years of age,
                 passed away at 11:00 Wednesday
                 night at her home. She was a full-

                 her father, mother, sisters, and
                 daughter."

       VIOLIN fades out.

       WE HEAR THE SOUND EFFECTS of a SHOVEL and DIRT being put on a
       casket.

                           RADIO SHOW PRODUCER (CONT'D)
                 There was no mention of the
                 murders.

                                                          CUT TO:



A247   EXT. OSAGE DRUM DANCE CELEBRATION - 2021                       A247

       CU A DRUM: THE LOUD BEAT OF SEVERAL DRUMMERS (MEN) AS THEY
       SIT AROUND THE DRUM. They are in CURRENT DAY CLOTHING.

       The CAMERA PULLS UP to reveal WOMEN SINGERS sitting around
       the drummers and continues up to reveal:

       A COLORFUL SWIRL of OSAGE PEOPLE DANCING AROUND THE DRUM,
       dressed in their own TRADITIONAL DANCE CLOTHING or EVERYDAY
       CLOTHES WITH BLANKETS.

       Color and movement fill the screen.

       A circle forms.

       We fade slowly.
